### 2022 PRIMARY ONE (P1) REGISTRATION EXERCISE FOR ADMISSION TO P1 IN 2023 - PHASE 1 REGISTRATION

Dear Parents / Guardians


Good day to you. 

  

Phase 1 registration is for a Singapore Citizen (SC) or Singapore Permanent Resident (SPR) child born between 2 Jan 2016 and 1 Jan 2017 (both dates inclusive) and has a sibling studying in our school.

If you have a SC or SPR child eligible for **Phase 1**, please submit the online form at [https://go.gov.sg/p1onlineform](https://go.gov.sg/p1onlineform) by **29th April 2022** (Friday).   

  

The following documents must be submitted to the school via email at [chijolgc\_parents@moe.edu.sg](mailto:chijolgc_parents@moe.edu.sg) by **29th April 2022 (Friday)** after you have completed the online form submission. The school will not be able to process your application until all the required documents have been received. 

  

**Documents required to be submitted by 29th April 2022 (Friday)**

Please indicate the child’s full name in the subject line when you email the documents required for the P1 registration. 

1.       Child’s Birth Certificate

The school will contact you should additional clarifications and / or documents be required. Your application is complete only after you have received the acknowledgement email from the school. Please look out for the acknowledgement email in your inbox (including spam and/or junk folder).

If your child is non-SC / non-SPR and thus not eligible for Phase 1, please submit an online Indication of Interest between **31 May 2022 and 6 Jun 2022** at [go.gov.sg/P1reg](http://go.gov.sg/P1reg).
