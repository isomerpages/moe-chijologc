## Aesthetics

With the ardent belief of ‘every child an artist/e’, the Aesthetics Department at OLGC aims to provide showcase platforms to our students for them to share their artistic and musical talents with their peers and schoolmates through the biennial Aesthetics Showcase or school Musical. Apart from school platforms, the department also actively seeks out local or regional competitive or platforms nationally or for students to gain art or music exposure beyond school.  

## Art Programmes

The Art Department at CHIJ OLGC aims to enable students to make and appreciate art through exposure and engagement. Through a myriad of artmaking processes, teachers hope to impart in students E21CC competencies such as adaptive thinking and communication.  

As part of their core learning, students experience drawing using different mediums through a myriad of methods introduced during their level drawing modules introduced in one of the terms in the year.  

Among digital and three-dimensional art programmes introduced are the primary 3 paper relief sculpture, primary 4 origami sculpture, primary five papier mâché sculpture modules as well as the primary six cut-out animation module. Through these modules, students 

## Music Programmes

Our philosophy towards music education at OLGC is centered in the belief that every child is musical can develop an aural sensitivity and nurture appreciation for diverse music cultures. 

Throughout their six years at OGLC, our students are introduced to a myriad of Music modules to hone their musicianship skills through learning various instruments. Along with opportunities to create and perform, music education at OLGC aims to enable students to cultivate a lifelong interest and appreciation of Music. In addition, our curriculum has been crafted with the aim to develop each child holistically in terms of 21st Century Competencies (21CC) values, character &amp; social-emotional well-being. 

Our primary one and two students for example, learn to coordinate their bodily actions/ movements with singalong through the world of show choir where they are guided to put up performances as a class. Our primary three students have the opportunity to pick up two percussion instruments - the ukulele &amp; the angklung. Through daily music lessons, they developed the technical proficiency for the instruments and hone their ensemble skills as they work together to put up performances. 

Our primary four students are introduced to the Kulintang, an Indonesian traditional percussion instrument. For many, it is their first time challenged to perform on an instrument physically bigger than themselves. On the other hand, the primary five girls are introduced to the world of Foley, where they are challenged to rethink Music creatively, by reconstructing sounds using everyday objects. In addition, they try their hand at playing the guitar, through learning fundamental chords and playing to their favourite songs. 

With digital music gaining popularity and virtual instruments becoming more accessible for music-making, our primary six students gain the fundamentals on performing digital instruments in a pop band setting. 

The Aesthetics Department at OLGC is proud to share the accolades that our students have received in the past three years:
