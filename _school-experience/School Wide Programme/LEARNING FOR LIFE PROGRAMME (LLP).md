## LEARNING FOR LIFE PROGRAMME (LLP)

The LLP focuses on real-life experiential learning to develop students’ character and values. It provides students with opportunities to lead in serving the community which helps to deepen values and life skills. The school adopts “The Leader In Me – 7 Habits of Highly Effective Student Leaders” for our student leadership programme.  

**Leadership through H3**  

The school uses the Head-Heart-Hand approach in the development of our student leaders.  

Head (Know, Understand and Appreciate) – Building on students’ intellectual capacity in understanding various knowledge and learning pertaining to leadership, skills and competencies.&nbsp;  

Heart (Gratitude, Empathy and Passion to Serve) – Nurturing students’ emotional domain in relating and working with others through leadership skills  

Hand (Inspire, Lead and Serve) – Developing students’ behaviour through providing a service to others.
