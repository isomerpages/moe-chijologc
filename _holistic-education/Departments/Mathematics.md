## Mathematics 

We seek to promote the learning of Mathematics through the elements of fun to engage students. The department conducts Math Fun@recess activities where students play simple games or try out hands on activities designed and prepared by teachers and parent volunteers from the Mums’ Club. Students can also try out the big floor game at the concourse. P1 and P2 classes are taught to play Math games like Swamp Sum and Rummikub and encouraged to try out the Math activities at the Math Activity corner within the classroom. Through the playing of games, students are encouraged unconsciously to apply their critical thinking and problem solving skills.  
  
To better engage our parents in their child’s learning of Mathematics, the department seeks to form a collaborative partnership with parents to promote parent-child bonding well as encourage parental support in their child’s learning in the area of Mathematics. The department has customised Parent-Child Home kits for P1 to P3 on selected topics for parents to work with their children at home.&nbsp; These kits comprise of board games, suggested activities and websites where parent and child can play and learn together.  
  
To further relate Mathematics to students’ daily lives, P4 students went through a 1 day Financial Literacy Programme where they learn good saving habits to prepare them for the future. Tapping on the nature of the subject, we also stretch out students to be good problem-solvers through the Mathematics Olympiad training offered by the school.
