<center><b>Message from Ms Vivienne Lim, Chairperson, CHIJ Board of Management</b></center>

The foundation of the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus Schools is anchored on the vision of our Founder, Blessed Nicolas Barré that centres around the child’s worth and potential, the transformative power of education and formation, holistic personal development rooted in love, and the creation of a caring and inclusive community under the guidance of faith and God’s Providence, with a special focus on the welfare of the least advantaged.

Blessed Nicolas Barré together with the Charitable Mistresses zealously committed to educating the children of the poor established the first "Little Schools" in Rouen in 1662. These Charitable Schools of the Infant Jesus spread rapidly across France and with pontifical recognition of the Order in 1866, the Infant Jesus Sisters set out on mission to the East, reaching Singapore in 1854.

CHIJ Schools have grown from strength to strength through fidelity to our Founder's vision, faith and trust in Divine Providence. The IJ Mission has flourished thanks to the unwavering love and sacrifices of generations of IJ Sisters, tireless dedication and selfless contributions of staff, alumnae and parents. It is because of this collective spirit that we now witness CHIJ Schools worldwide standing as enduring educational institutions that have nurtured and shaped the hearts and minds of countless students.

May we always be mindful that the purpose of an IJ Education is to ignite the flame of learning. Students are guided, inspired and supported in their unique journey of self-discovery and personal development. We recognise that each student is a distinct individual with untapped potential, waiting to shine but she grows and develops in community. Her gifts are developed for others in the community and each person has an influence on others.

Let our words and actions uplift others with graciousness and strength. Let us embody qualities of generosity, humility and compassion. Let us remain grateful for the blessings we receive, and let the Gospel guide us in transcending trials, temptations and tribulations. In the pursuit of happiness, may we find fulfillment in serving others and walk in the footsteps of Blessed Nicolas Barré and Mother Mathilde.

CHIJ Our Lady of Good Counsel has successfully nurtured a vibrant community of girls who always stand by each other, especially during challenging times. Your steadfast pursuit of developing the whole person – cognitively, emotionally and spiritually – has been the bedrock of your success. Your commitment to instilling future-oriented skills and sound moral values in our girls ensures the cultivation of strong and compassionate leaders for tomorrow.

In an increasingly complex global landscape, the IJ core values of Truth, Justice, Freedom and Love and our school motto ‘Simple in Virtue, Steadfast in Duty’ will continue to guide the IJ Community well, in nurturing students to lead enriching and valuable lives, as integral persons who would contribute to the world and local communities.

May God continue to bless CHIJ Our Lady of Good Counsel, her leaders, staff, students, alumnae and parents, as always.

Yours in Christ

Ms Vivienne Lim<br>
