## SCHOOL HYMN

**VERSE 1**

  We are children of God, chosen to lead in truth

  Justice, freedom and love, granted by God above

  Help us to persevere, with humility

  Our Lady of Good Counsel, guide us to strive for integrity

**CHORUS**

We are ladies of grace, leaders of the future

Simple in virtue; steadfast in duty

With Christ as our guide, we will faithfully praise Him

Be true to his name, with joy we acclaim in unity

**VERSE 2**

  We are children of God, compassionate to all,

  We will strive to succeed, in thought, word and deed

  Dear Lord please grant our prayers, from humble hearts,

  That with confidence and excellence , we’ll do our part.
