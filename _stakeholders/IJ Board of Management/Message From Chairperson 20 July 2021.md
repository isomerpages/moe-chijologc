## MESSAGE FROM CHAIRPERSON 20 JULY 2021

**Message from Chairperson of CHIJ Board of Management**  

Dear Teachers, Students, Parents and Staff of our CHIJ Schools,

  

The news of the recent attack at River Valley High School came as a tremendous

shock to everyone. We grieve with the family of the boy who was killed. Our hearts

and prayers are with them, with the family of the boy who has now been charged,

and with the students and staff of River Valley High School.

  

I am sure that for many teachers, students and parents, this tragic incident brings

about much uncertainty. There may be questions on our minds and fear in our

hearts, as we try to make sense of it all. The fact that this is taking place in the midst

of rapidly rising number of Covid cases and uncertainties about the days ahead

would have added to your anxiety. Some students may wonder whether they will be

safe at school.

  

The safety and well-being of our girls, teachers and staff are of paramount

importance. Each one of you is precious to us. Let us as a community remain

steadfast in our duties and work together to ensure that our schools remain safe

havens for our girls to learn, to grow and to thrive.

  

If any student needs help, or knows someone who needs help, please reach out to

an adult, your teachers, the school counsellors or the IJ Sisters. You are not alone.

The IJ Community is here for you and will do our best to support you.

  

It is in times like this that we must pull together. Let us do what we can to look out

for one another, to take care of each other and to respond always with love and kindness. Please be assured of our continued prayers and love.
