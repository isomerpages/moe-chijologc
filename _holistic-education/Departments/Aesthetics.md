<h2>Aesthetics</h2>
<p>With the ardent belief of ‘every child an artist/e’, the Aesthetics Department
at OLGC aims to provide showcase platforms to our students for them to
share their artistic and musical talents with their peers and schoolmates
through the biennial Aesthetics Showcase or school Musical. Apart from
school platforms, the department also actively seeks out local or regional
competitive or platforms nationally or for students to gain art or music
exposure beyond school.</p>
<h2>Art Programmes</h2>
<p>The Art Department at CHIJ OLGC aims to enable students to make and appreciate
art through exposure and engagement. Through a myriad of artmaking processes,
teachers hope to impart in students E21CC competencies such as adaptive
thinking and communication.</p>
<p>As part of their core learning, students experience drawing using different
mediums through a myriad of methods introduced during their level drawing
modules introduced in one of the terms in the year.</p>
<p>Among digital and three-dimensional art programmes introduced are the
primary 3 paper relief sculpture, primary 4 origami sculpture, primary
five papier mâché sculpture modules as well as the primary six cut-out
animation module. Through these modules, students</p>
<h2>Music Programmes</h2>
<p>Our philosophy towards music education at OLGC is centered in the belief
that every child is musical can develop an aural sensitivity and nurture
appreciation for diverse music cultures.</p>
<p>Throughout their six years at OGLC, our students are introduced to a myriad
of Music modules to hone their musicianship skills through learning various
instruments. Along with opportunities to create and perform, music education
at OLGC aims to enable students to cultivate a lifelong interest and appreciation
of Music. In addition, our curriculum has been crafted with the aim to
develop each child holistically in terms of 21st Century Competencies (21CC)
values, character &amp; social-emotional well-being.</p>
<p>Our primary one and two students for example, learn to coordinate their
bodily actions/ movements with singalong through the world of show choir
where they are guided to put up performances as a class. Our primary three
students have the opportunity to pick up two percussion instruments - the
ukulele &amp; the angklung. Through daily music lessons, they developed
the technical proficiency for the instruments and hone their ensemble skills
as they work together to put up performances.</p>
<p>Our primary four students are introduced to the Kulintang, an Indonesian
traditional percussion instrument. For many, it is their first time challenged
to perform on an instrument physically bigger than themselves. On the other
hand, the primary five girls are introduced to the world of Foley, where
they are challenged to rethink Music creatively, by reconstructing sounds
using everyday objects. In addition, they try their hand at playing the
guitar, through learning fundamental chords and playing to their favourite
songs.</p>
<p>With digital music gaining popularity and virtual instruments becoming
more accessible for music-making, our primary six students gain the fundamentals
on performing digital instruments in a pop band setting.</p>
<p>The Aesthetics Department at OLGC is proud to share the accolades that
our students have received in the past three years:</p>
