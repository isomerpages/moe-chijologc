## Malay Language 

The Malay Language Department seeks to deepen the roots and sense of identity within the Malay community while fostering an appreciation of its rich cultural heritage. Centered on the **21CC Competencies** of Civic, Global, and Cross-Cultural Literacy.

Students are introduced to six key aspects of **Malay culture**â€”traditional games, wedding, cuisine and food culture, music, literature, and handicrafts. Each year, one aspect is highlighted during the **MTL Fortnight**, providing students with an immersive and focused experience. Through this structured approach over six years, students gain a comprehensive understanding of the cultural richness and diversity of the Malay community. 

Beyond academic learning, this initiative nurtures cultural awareness, respect, and a deeper appreciation for Malay heritage. By the end of their primary education, students will have developed a strong awareness of their own cultural identity and that of others, enabling them **to play active and constructive roles in promoting social cohesion.**
