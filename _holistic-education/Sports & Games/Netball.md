## Netball

The Netball CCA has been newly introduced CCA in 2019. It was reopened since its closure due to PERI upgrading.

### Programme


Students acquire new skills and learn the importance of teamwork, resilience and discipline. The CCA consists of only the Recreational Team currently as team members are relatively new to netball. However, the school is planning to expose them to Netball carnivals and friendly games. This is done so as to allow students to have a holistic experience as they meet new friends from other schools and interact with them through their love of the sport.
