## Art

Art is an important tool for expression and a mode of communication. The aims of art education in Singapore schools are to enable every child to enjoy art, communicate visually, and make meaning through connecting with society and culture. This empowers them to make meaning of their own lives in conjunction with the world around them.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

The Art Department at CHIJ Our Lady of Good Counsel aims to expose our students to various art forms throughout their six years with us. This year, we have planned a myriad of diverse art projects for our students from Primary One to Six. A sampling of their works are provided for viewing.&nbsp;

During the full Home Based Learning, our Primary 1 to Primary 3 students also completed an artwork based on the simple idea of Origami or paper folding. Using square coloured papers that they have at home, our students were guided to complete the following projects

| Primary 1                        | Primary 2                                | Primary 3                           |

The school also embarked on a whole school project since last 2019. Different level worked on different aspect of the 3D sculpture and their contribution were pieced together and the IJ City was born.

_<center>Project Title: Building the IJ City- CHIJ Our Lady of Good Counsel</center>_  

This artwork is a Bicentennial commemorative piece that aims to convey our students’ efforts and contributions to nation-building after they graduate. IJ schools have roots that date back to over 165 years and IJ students’ contribution to society is evident in whatever professions they choose to turn their dreams into reality.

In response to Pope Francis's letter, "Laudato Si",   the school embarked on a recycling project where students conceptualised their dream city as one powered by clean, renewable energy and resources. Their collaborative effort aims to inspire the idea of sustainability as well as remind us of the negative impact that mass consumerism can have on the environment.  

This artwork has been shifted to the Sustainable Singapore Gallery at Marina Barrage for an upcoming exhibition before the Circuit Breaker was enforced. Updates of the exhibition will be provided in the gallery’s website.
