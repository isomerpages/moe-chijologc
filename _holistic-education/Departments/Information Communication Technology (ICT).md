### Baseline ICT Standards (New Media Literacies)

In OLGC, students undergo an ICT training programme to equip them with the skills and competencies to leverage on the affordances of using technology for learning.

Students will be able to utilise appropriate digital tools and applications to organise own learning, create reports or presentations to document own learning and utilise appropriate digital tools and applications to work with others and share information.
