## CHARACTER AND CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION

In CHIJ OLGC, we hope to engage our students in the development of values, knowledge, skills and attitudes to help them become responsible and thinking so as to be Ladies of Character, Leaders for Tomorrow.&nbsp;  
  
We strongly believe that Character Education is a shared responsibility of all staff members, parents and external partners, such as trainers and coaches. Inherently, every teacher is also a CCE teacher and every teacher infuses the teaching of values in their respective subjects, CCA or through their daily interactions with students. With this shared belief and understanding, all staff members are also committed in partnering closely with community groups in character-building.&nbsp;  
  
Our school core values of Compassion, Humility, Integrity and Perseverance (CHIP) are part of our everyday language as they are promoted during our daily sharing and intentionally articulated by our staff and students.   
  
Recognising the importance of enhancing relationships with peers and teachers to strengthen a culture of care, the Adopted Sisters Programme and Form Teacher Guidance Periods are an integral part of our character education.  
  
Family spirit is key in OLGC. Sisterly bonds are developed through our Adopted Sisters’ Programme. Upper primary girls take the lead to guide their younger sisters in various school activities. Through these experiences, the students imbibe the virtues of love, compassion and humility  
  
Students are also equipped with goal-setting skills using My Personal Goals Action Plan as they are reflect on the progress they make in achieving their academic and non-academic goals.

### Student Well-Being

Various support programmes are also in place to provide the provision of care for the total well-being and development of our students. These support programmes include parent-teacher meetings, teacher-student conferencing sessions, various financial assistance schemes, special needs support and counselling support. These support programmes are headed by the Year Heads, School Administrative Team, Form Teachers, Senior School Counsellor and Special Educational Needs Officer.

### Values In Action(VIA)

At CHIJ OLGC, we believe in nurturing compassionate and socially responsible citizens.
Our Values in Action (VIA) programme is designed to provide students with meaningful
opportunities to contribute to the community and develop a sense of civic responsibility
using the Head-Heart-Hand approach.
Through age-appropriate activities, our students learn to empathise with others, understand
societal needs, and take action to make a positive difference.

**Level Outcomes:<br>
**Primary 1 and 2: Developing Awareness and Empathy**<br>
Our youngest students focus on understanding the importance of kindness, helping others, and being a blessing to others. They participate in:<br>

Outcome: NKF Champs VIA programme: Students bring Christmas cheer to National Kidney
Foundation (NKF) patients by creating cards and handmade Christmas bracelets. Through
this activity, they learn the importance of compassion and how small gestures can brighten
the lives of those facing health challenges.

**Primary 3 and 4: “Taking Pride in our School Environment”** to help to create a conducive environment for everyone in the school. 

Students look beyond their immediate surroundings and take an active role in improving their school environment such as:

•	Beautification projects for classrooms and common areas<br>
•	Creating awareness campaigns for cleanliness and proper use of school facilities

Outcome: Through the "Taking Pride in our School Environment" initiative, students gain a broader understanding of community needs, starting with their immediate school community. They learn to take initiative in improving their surroundings, develop a sense of ownership and responsibility for shared spaces, and understand how their actions can positively impact the entire school community. This expanded perspective prepares them for wider community engagement in later years.

**Primary 5 and Primary 6: Broadening Perspectives and Community Engagement**<br>
Our Primary 5 and 6 students expand their understanding of community needs and social
Issues through exposure to various organisations:

• Mount Alvernia Hospital sharing session: Students attend a presentation to understand
the work of the hospital, gaining insights into healthcare services and the importance of
community health.

• Archdiocesan Commission for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant People (ACMI)
sharing: Students learn about the challenges faced by migrants and itinerant people,
fostering empathy and awareness of diverse community needs.

In turn, our students create cards and virtue bracelets for nurses and migrants to show
their appreciation. <br>
<br>
Outcome: Through the activity, students are able to express their gratitude for the essential
work of healthcare professionals and show support and appreciation for migrants in our
community. 

**Primary 6: Community Outreach**

Our Primary 6 students take on leadership roles and engage in activities that connect them
directly with the wider community:<br>
• Christmas Card Project: Students continue the tradition of making Christmas cards for
the neighbours of OLGC to spread the joy of Christmas. 
This activity:<br>
•	Encourages creativity and thoughtfulness<br>
•	Helps students understand the importance of community relations<br>
•	Promotes the spirit of giving and spreading joy

P6 prefects, accompanied by their Form teachers, take on the role of postmen to deliver
the Christmas cards to neighbours. <br>
This experience:<br>
•	Develops leadership skills and responsibility in prefects<br>
•	Provides direct community engagement<br>
•	Teaches students about the impact of personal interactions in community building
