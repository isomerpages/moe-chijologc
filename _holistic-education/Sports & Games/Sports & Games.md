## SPORTS & GAMES


We have four sports and games for our students to select from once they reached Primary 3 and these are usually the preferred CCAs for students who are more sports-inclined. Our Sports and Games athletes are identified and very committed as they have to undergo selective and tedious training processes. They also have an advantage during Direct School Admissions (DSA) exercise as many secondary schools are often on the lookout for outstanding student athletes during Zonal and National sports competitions.
