Dear Parents / Guardians

Greetings from the OLGC family. We hope that the year has been a smooth one thus far.  2024 is an especially significant year for the CHIJ community in Singapore as we celebrate 170 years of IJ presence in Singapore. As we take stock of the history of the IJ community in Singapore, we give thanks for the many hands who contributed to the establishment of the IJ mission on our shores and held on to the IJ dream. In a special way, we pay tribute to Mother Mathilde, one of four IJ sisters who was relentless in the pursuit of making the world a better place, overcoming harsh conditions at sea travelling from France to South-east Asia, first to Penang and then arriving in Singapore in 1854. 

**Resilience and an innovative spirit**   

Throughout her life, Mother Mathilde was led by this simple call: to dedicate her life to the service of others. She left her homeland and family behind to answer God’s call, uncertain of what lay ahead, only knowing that she wanted to create a better world for others. Working hard and with others, she established convents, schools and orphanages from scratch. She did not wait for circumstances to be ‘ready’ for her to help others; she used her wit and ingenuity and took steady steps in her work of uplifting others and doing good. Undeterred by her not speaking English, Mother Mathilde had to quickly pick it up and with her warmth, she gained the trust of the locals, especially as she courageously sought to help families and rescue young girls, to provide for their education and future. With compassion and boldness, Mother Mathilde was a woman ahead of her time as she reflects the enhanced 21st century competencies of critical, adaptive and inventive thinking, as well as communication and collaborative skills, transcending the reliance on words in persuading others that she was someone who genuinely cared for the people and ‘had their backs’. 

**Leader with a heart for others**

Leading with personal example, Mother Mathilde was known for her compassion for others. There was a postulant (someone starting on the journey to becoming a nun) who had grown up used to having a servant to take care of her and wondered who was going to clean her room and make her bed. When she asked Mother Mathilde who was assigned to be the chambermaid to her room, she received a vague answer. Later that evening, the postulant found a little broom and a feather duster in her room, with a note “A gift from a mother to her child”. The postulant learnt well and not only proceeded to keep her own room clean, she learnt to look out for how else she could help and serve those around her. Without putting her down, Mother Mathilde respectfully taught that girl how she could be better. 

There are many aspects of Mother Mathilde’s life which provide food for thought. While her achievements leave us awestruck, let us be inspired to emulate her character, her virtues and her pioneering spirit as we continue to be Simple in Virtue, Steadfast in Duty. In OLGC, we will continue to shape our girls to be Ladies of Character and Leaders for Tomorrow and play our part to keep the IJ dream vibrantly alive.   

Wishing you and your family a restful mid-year break. 

Thank you and God bless.
