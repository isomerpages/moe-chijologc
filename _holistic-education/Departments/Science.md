## Science 

The Science department engages our students and helps them make connections between scientific concepts learnt in class and the real world. Programmes are customised for students to develop process skills, desirable attitudes, raise awareness and learn about scientific applications in daily life.  

Science concepts are taught through inquiry and hands-on activities. To instil love and care for our environment, the Green Programme is also infused into the curriculum. Learning journeys to scientific places of interest are also organised to extend studentsâ€™ learning beyond the classroom.
