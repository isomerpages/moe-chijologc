## Art

Art is an important tool for expression and a mode of communication. The aims of art education in Singapore schools are to enable every child to enjoy art, communicate visually, and make meaning through connecting with society and culture. This empowers them to make meaning of their own lives in conjunction with the world around them.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

The Art Department at CHIJ Our Lady of Good Counsel aims to expose our students to various art forms throughout their six years with us. This year, we have planned a myriad of diverse art projects for our students from Primary One to Six. A sampling of their works are provided for viewing.&nbsp;
