<p>As I pen these final thoughts for the school yearbook, marking the close
of my 15-year tenure as Chairperson of the IJ Board of Management, I do
so with a heart overflowing with gratitude.<br><br>It has been one of the greatest
privileges of my life to serve this treasured institution that is the CHIJ
Mission, a legacy founded 363 years ago in France and 171 years ago in
Singapore. I am deeply grateful for the chance to serve alongside our ever-faithful
and beloved IJ Sisters, as well as the esteemed and selfless members of
the IJ Board of Management, and be constantly inspired by each of them.
<br><br>
I am very grateful for the many opportunities to work with each of your
inspiring school leaders who lead with heart and clarity of purpose, always
anchored in the mission entrusted to them. I am profoundly thankful to
have witnessed, year after year, the steady and remarkable growth of CHIJ
Our Lady of Good Counsel. My heartfelt appreciation goes to the dedicated
teachers and non-teaching staff who give so generously of themselves to
the school, and most especially, to our girls. To witness your individual
growth, your collective achievements, and to hear of your contributions
to the greater good has been the truest reward of this service. <br><br>At its
heart, the CHIJ mission of education is a ministry of love – one that seeks
to touch lives, awaken purpose, and form hearts rooted in faith. From the
vision of Blessed Nicolas Barré to the pioneering spirit of Mother Mathilde
Raclot, the mission calls us to uplift, to empower, to see beyond differences
or limitations, and to nurture the whole person. I am very heartened to
see this sacred mission continue to endure and thrive in CHIJ Our Lady
of Good Counsel today. <br><br>The journey of life brings both joys and challenges.
At times, the path has felt uncertain and moments of darkness touch us.
Yet it is in these very moments that we are called to be beacons of hope
and light, to shine most brightly when shadows fall. My hope is that we
strive to walk with one another, to lift one another when we stumble, and
to carry the light for those who find it difficult to see. In doing so,
we live out the mission of our CHIJ schools: to form persons of integrity,
faith, love, and service. <br><br>May gratitude shape your outlook, may faith sustain
your courage in times of challenge, and may hope inspire you to be a light
for others. And may we always strive to be “Simple in Virture, Steadfast
in Duty”. <br><br>It has been my profound honour to share this journey with you.<br><br>
May God continue to bless CHIJ Our Lady of Good Counsel, her leaders, teaching
and non-teaching staff, students, parents and alumnae, now and always.</p><br><br>
<p>With Thanksgiving and Love, <br><br>Vivienne Lim <br>Chairperson<br> IJ Board of Management</p>
