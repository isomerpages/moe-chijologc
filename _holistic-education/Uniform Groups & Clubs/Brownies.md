## Brownies 

Brownies is part of the Guiding Movement of Girl Guides Singapore. This uniformed group aims to provide our girls with the opportunity for self-training in the development of character, in the realisation of responsible global citizenship and promotion of service to the community.

### Programme

During the CCA sessions, Brownies are exposed to a range of indoor and outdoor activities to help them to develop them in different aspects: physical, social and mental aspects.
