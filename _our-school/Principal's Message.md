Dear Parents / Guardians

As 2025 draws to a close, let us pause and look back on the year which has passed. Our thoughts may dwell on achievements and outcomes which we are proud of and in OLGC, we are certainly blessed with many talents among our girls; from victories at National School Games (NSG) events and accolades for our performing and visual arts groups, to personal victories seen in improved results in subjects one struggled with. However, if our joy is only driven by the results, we fail to appreciate more important lessons as the process of learning is as, if not even more important than the outcome. So beyond the results, do take time to notice for example, how your daughter has grown in confidence to solve problems in a safe and **resourceful** manner especially when there are challenges, how she has developed a greater spirit of **resilience** in the face of setbacks and how she has learnt to communicate and collaborate **respectfully** and work with others. Or how she has learnt to be more **reflective** and take **responsibility** for mistakes she admits she has made. These attributes make up OLGC’s Learning Dispositions (LDs), which are key to developing the lifelong learner. Through the variety of learning experiences planned in OLGC, our focus remains committed on developing the LDs and sound values which together build our girls as Ladies of Character, Leaders for Tomorrow. To that end, our staff and teachers put in, often, quiet work in providing a caring and enabling environment towards the holistic development of our girls daily. Indeed, there are many examples of role models amongst them.     

This year, OLGC celebrates her 65th anniversary. Mother Mathilde and the first IJ sisters were guided by their love for God and their hearts full of gratitude and generosity in selflessly establishing the schools in Singapore; that has touched many lives including all of us in OLGC. Many hands have contributed to the holistic development of the child in OLGC over the years. In a fast-paced changing world where upholding ethics and moral values is increasingly seen as inconvenient, we are grateful for and inspired by our IJ sisters, past school leaders, staff and teachers who have held firm to that ideal even when it was not convenient. Their dedication demonstrates the theme for our celebration “Hearts in Harmony: Celebrating a Legacy of Love and Learning”. 

We are certainly grateful for the strong support we have enjoyed from our parents and look forward to this continued partnership in the educational journey of our girls. As we look towards the next phase of OLGC’s journey, may those who have walked this path in building OLGC to what she is today be an inspiration for us. May our personal victories in growing our gifts be always used to make the community around us an even better place for all, as we live our school motto “Simple in Virtue, Steadfast in Duty”. 

Wishing you and your family a restful holiday and to all who celebrate Christmas, a blessed advent season and Christmas. We look forward to welcoming you all back in 2026. 

God bless.
