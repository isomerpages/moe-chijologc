## 60th Anniversary

*<center>The 60th Anniversary logo of the IJ blue heart symbolises the love of IJ family for the community just like that of Our Lady of Good Counsel’s unconditional love for her child Jesus.</center>*

**Theme of the 60th Anniversary: With Love, We Bless**

  

CHIJ Our Lady of Good Counsel was established in 1960. This year, we celebrate 60 years of "Valuing our Past, Cherishing our Present, and having High Hopes for the Future."  

  

Through the gates of the school, thousands of girls have graduated, many of whom are doing well in serving the family and community and continuing the IJ legacy of being Simple in Virtue and Steadfast in Duty.

  

As the school marks another milestone, the staff and students alike aim to be a blessing in our own capacity to all around us. There will be various events and activities held to celebrate this special occasion, for example the Feast Day Mass, an Interactive Walk and Heritage corner, outreach efforts to the community and the year end Musical.  

  

**Interactive Walk and Heritage Corner**

An Interactive Walk will be set up around the school where students get to learn about the school’s unique spaces i.e Garden of Peace, and information about the different stages of the school’s development. The walk includes various activities i.e quizzes using QR codes.  

  

The walk will include a view of a Giving Tree installation at the school foyer. Hung on this tree are words of appreciation from the students to the school. The walk will end at the updated Heritage Corner outside the General Office where the timeline of key events of the school and oral accounts of former students of the time spent at the event/place will be displayed 

  

**Musical**

To convey the message of “With Love We Bless”, a musical put together by our students, will be held in November. The musical includes scenes of the Nativity Play, as well as our Founder, Father Nicholas Barre.

  

**Outreach Effort**

  

Conscious of their responsibilities as stewards of God’s creation,  the Primary 1 to Primary 6 students from the 2019 classes first conceptualized their dream city as one that is powered by clean, renewable energy and resources. They then selected various scrap materials to translate their artistic ideas into images of infrastructure for their dream city. They also included iconic Singapore buildings such as the Marina Bay Sands, Chinatown shop houses and the Singapore Changi Airport.   

  

Through upcycling materials such as bottles, cardboards and magazines, the girls eventually stuck on their painted images on and created a miniature representation of their dream IJ city.    

  

Their collaborative effort aims to inspire the idea of sustainability as well as remind all of the negative impact of mass consumerism on the environment. The contributions of the various levels are summarized as:  

  

Primary 1: Transportation sculptures  

Primary 2: Playground sculptures and human/ animal figures  

Primary 3 & Primary 4: Building sculptures  

Primary 5 & Primary 6: Singapore skyline  

  

The exhibition will be held at the Sustainable Singapore Gallery (SSG) at Marina Barrage from 18 to 30 March 2020.  

  

May we, with love, bless others.
