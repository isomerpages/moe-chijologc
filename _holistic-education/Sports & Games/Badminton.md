## Badminton 

Badminton is a co-curricular activity in OLGC which caters to both competitive and recreational players. It allows students to learn specific skills required to play the sport well, to persevere and develop good sportsmanship and discipline. By demonstrating fair play, students will be able to practise our school values, integrity, and perseverance. During the training sessions, students will also learn to interact with their teammates and espouse the values of friendship.
