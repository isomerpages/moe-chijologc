## Science 

The Science department engages our students and helps them make connections between scientific concepts learnt in class and the real world. Programmes are customised for students to develop process skills, desirable attitudes, raise awareness and learn about scientific applications in daily life.  

Science concepts are taught through inquiry and hands-on activities. To instil love and care for our environment, the Green Programme is also infused into the curriculum. Learning journeys to scientific places of interest are also organised to extend students’ learning beyond the classroom.

### Programmes


*   STELLAR in Science for P1 &amp; P2

To excite our students and encourage self-directed learning, our students undertake to complete a few Science modules to learn simple Science concepts and relate these concepts to the world around them.  
  

*   Enrichment: Learning Journeys, Workshops and Recess Activities

Science learning journeys bring excitement and curiosity for Science to a higher level. These learning journeys support the curriculum as well as further enhance our students’ learning and attitude towards Science.

*   **Science Supplementary and Remedial Lessons**

To better support and stretch our students in their learning of Science, supplementary and remedial lessons are conducted weekly.&nbsp;&nbsp;  

  

*   **Young Professor Activities**  
    

To encourage self-directed learning as well as to further interest our students in the curriculum, our students also undertake to complete the activities in the Young Professor Award Series:&nbsp;  

*   P3 - Young Theophrastus Award  
     
 *   P4 - Young Aristotle Award  
     
   *   P5 - Young Darwin Award

*   **Four-year Process Skills Development Programme**<br>
Students are provided with opportunities to apply learned concepts and skills, by engaging the surrounding environment and its processes and phenomena for the purpose of inquiry, awareness and&nbsp;self-development.

### Skills

*   Formulating hypothesis  

This is the skill of making a general explanation for a related set of observations or events. It is an extension of inferring.

<u>Collecting and presenting evidence through:</u>

  
*   Observing  
    

This is the skill of using our senses to gather information about objects or events. This also includes the use of instruments to extend the range of our senses.  


*   Using apparatus and equipment

This is the skill of knowing the functions and limitations of various apparatus, and developing the ability to select and handle them appropriately for various tasks.
  

<u>Reasoning; making meaning of information and evidence through:</u>


*   Comparing

This is the skill of transmitting and receiving information presented in various forms - verbal, pictorial, tabular or graphical.

### Processes


Processes are complex operations which require the use of several skills.  
  

*   Creative Problem Solving  
    
Analysing a problem and choosing an innovative and relevant solution to alter a problem situation.  

  

*   Decision-Making  
    
Establishing and applying criteria to select from among seemingly equal alternatives with consideration to consequences and values.
