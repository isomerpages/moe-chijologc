## Mathematics 

In our school, we believe that mathematics is a fundamental subject that develops critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and logical reasoning

Our Approach:

We strive to make math engaging and relevant for all students. Our curriculum balances core mathematical concepts with real-world applications, fostering both understanding and appreciation of the subject. We also emphasise the development of 21st Century Competencies (21CC) skills to prepare our students for the future. This includes fostering critical and inventive thinking, communication, collaboration, and information skills, integrated seamlessly into our mathematics instruction.

Teaching Strategies:
We employ a range of proven strategies to enhance mathematical understanding:

1. CPA Approach (Concrete, Pictorial, Abstract): Helping students progress from hands-on learning to abstract thinking
2. Learning Experience: Providing meaningful contexts for mathematical concepts
3. Polya's Problem Solving Model: Teaching a systematic approach to tackle complex problems
4. Model Drawing: Using visual representations to solve word problems
5. Heuristics Skills: Developing a toolkit of problem-solving techniques
6. Differentiated Instructions: Tailoring teaching methods to meet individual student needs and learning styles

Curriculum:
We follow the MOE Math curriculum, which centers around problem-solving. This curriculum aims to develop students' ability to apply mathematical concepts and skills to a wide range of problems. Key areas include:
- Number and Algebra
- Geometry and Measurement
- Statistics and Probability

The curriculum emphasizes the development of mathematical processes such as reasoning, communication, and connections, all within the context of problem-solving.

Activities and Programmes:
We organize a variety of exciting activities throughout the year to make math fun. These include Math Week and various level-specific learning activities. These programmes are designed to reinforce mathematical concepts through hands-on experiences and real-world applications.

Student Voice and Peer Learning:
We believe in empowering our students and fostering a collaborative learning environment. Our Primary 4 Buddy Programme exemplifies this approach:

- Math Buddy Programme: Primary 4 students take on the role of mentors, helping their Primary 2 ‘sisters’ learn maths in a fun and engaging manner. This programme not only reinforces mathematical concepts for both age groups but also develops leadership skills and builds strong bonds across year levels. Encouraged by the good response from the P2 students, we started the P3 and P5 Math Buddy Programme in 2025.

Enrichment Programmes:
To challenge and stretch our high-achieving students, we offer:

- Math Olympiad lessons: Preparing students for advanced problem-solving competitions
- Excellence 2000 Math (E2K Math): An enrichment programme designed to develop higher-order thinking skills and mathematical creativity.
