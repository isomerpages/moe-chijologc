## LEARNING FOR LIFE PROGRAMME (LLP)

The LLP focuses on real-life experiential learning to develop students’ character and values. It provides students with opportunities to lead in serving the community which helps to deepen values and life skills. The school adopts “The Leader In Me – 7 Habits of Highly Effective Student Leaders” for our student leadership programme.  

**Leadership through H3**  

The school uses the Head-Heart-Hand approach in the development of our student leaders.  

Head (Know, Understand and Appreciate) – Building on students’ intellectual capacity in understanding various knowledge and learning pertaining to leadership, skills and competencies.&nbsp;  

Heart (Gratitude, Empathy and Passion to Serve) – Nurturing students’ emotional domain in relating and working with others through leadership skills  

Hand (Inspire, Lead and Serve) – Developing students’ behaviour through providing a service to others.

As part of the CHIJ 170th anniversary, our student leaders took on the Laudato Si’ Gardening Project to show their gratitude to Mother Mathilde and the early IJ sisters by committing to care for our common home and making a stand to protect our earth as their way of serving and making a positive difference just like Mother Mathilde and the early sisters. For Teachers’ day, our student leaders also presented a small pot of blue pea plant to our teachers on behalf of the student body. The blue pea plant is chosen because the blue pea flowers symbolise calmness and wisdom, just like our teachers. We are humbled to share that we came in 1st in position for the **Laudato Si’ in Bloom Gardening Competition** for the beginner category. Our student leaders hope to inspire the rest of their fellow schoolmates to be ambassadors for the environment.
