26 October 2020

  

Dear Ms Grace Tan, VPs, Staff, Pupils &amp; Parents of CHIJ Our Lady of Good Counsel

  

**Message from Chairperson, CHIJ Board of Management**

2020 has been a challenging year for the world, for our country and our community. The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic continues to disrupt the physical, social, economic and spiritual aspects of our lives. Many in our community have been badly affected during this difficult period. The Circuit Breaker and continued Safe Management Measures have also required us to establish and adapt to new norms in the way we work, communicate, learn and interact with each other.  

  

But 2020 can also be remembered as a year where the CHIJ Our Lady of Good Counsel Community quickly rallied and came together as one to support and enable each other to adapt to the many changes and challenges, and in the process demonstrating the spirit of community, of compassion, resilience and love as exhorted of us by our IJ Mission.  

  

School leaders, teachers and staff worked tirelessly, undertaking meticulous planning to ensure that the school remained a safe environment for our girls. At the same time, they had to very quickly pick up new digital skills to ensure the continuity of teaching and learning in a new digital environment during Home-Based Learning. Amidst that, they continued to keep a vigilant look out for and rendered assistance and support to pupils and families who were struggling to cope with the school closures and economic uncertainties.  

  

Pupils had to quickly adapt to new social distancing rules, new ways of learning, and numerous restrictions and yet they undertook all that with much positivity and good cheer. Kudos too to parents who rallied to support our pupils in their Home-Based Learning, and supporting the school and teachers in many ways. It was heartening that amidst all that was happening, the CHIJ Our Lady of Good Counsel Community continued in their concerted efforts to reach out and care for the greater community, supporting the needy, showing appreciation to healthcare, migrant and other frontline workers, all the while remaining steadfast in their commitment to being ambassadors for peace and ambassadors in caring for our environment.  

  

Throughout this challenging period, the staff, the pupils of CHIJ Our Lady of Good Counsel and their parents, have demonstrated commendable resilience, dedication and adaptability.  

  

Let us build on the foundation that this Covid “year” has forged for us. Let us be guided by our IJ Motto, “Simple in Virtue, Steadfast in Duty”, as we continue to build a more inclusive, compassionate and loving society.  

  

May God continue to bless CHIJ Our Lady of Good Counsel, her leaders, staff and pupils, always.  

  

Yours in Christ
