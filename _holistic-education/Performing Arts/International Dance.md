## International Dance

The International Dance CCA started in 2015. From a group of merely 13 dancers, we have expanded our pool of talented dancers to above 50 dancers over the years. Our dancers, OLGC Sparkles, are very passionate and dedicated to the CCA and have been putting in their best during performances. Each dancer has unique talents that enable the CCA to grow.
