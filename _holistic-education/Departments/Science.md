## Science 

The Science department engages our students and helps them make connections between scientific concepts learnt in class and the real world. Programmes are customised for students to develop process skills, desirable attitudes, raise awareness and learn about scientific applications in daily life.  

Science concepts are taught through inquiry and hands-on activities. To instil love and care for our environment, the Green Programme is also infused into the curriculum. Learning journeys to scientific places of interest are also organised to extend students’ learning beyond the classroom.

### Programmes


*   STELLAR in Science for P1 &amp; P2

To excite our students and encourage self-directed learning, our students undertake to complete a few Science modules to learn simple Science concepts and relate these concepts to the world around them.  
  

*   Enrichment: Learning Journeys, Workshops and Recess Activities

Science learning journeys bring excitement and curiosity for Science to a higher level. These learning journeys support the curriculum as well as further enhance our students’ learning and attitude towards Science.
