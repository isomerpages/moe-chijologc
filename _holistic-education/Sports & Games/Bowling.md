## Bowling

Bowling CCA provides both training for recreational and competition levels. Students embark in this CCA with the interest to hone their skills in learning how to play the game. We have students who no only have represented OLGC in competitions but also have a history of producing National team players such as Amanda Lee, Nicole Lee, Arielle Tay and Arianne Tay, over the years, to represent Singapore in bringing in glory to our nation.
  
**Objectives**  

* Providing the mastery of bowling skills
* Inculcating sportsmanship and school values in our students
  
**Programme**  

Our training venue is Forte Bowl located within JForte Sportainment Centre. The training programme caters to various levels. Primary 3 and 4 form one training block, and Primary 5 and 6 form another. Within the blocks, the coaches and teachers will select students, based on their competencies and aptitude, to represent the school in the Singapore Primary School National School Games.
