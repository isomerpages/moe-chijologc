## Malay Dance

Malay Dance was started with the intention of getting students to understand the Malay culture and roots. Students are exposed to intricate dance moves and adorn colourful traditional costumes and headgear.

### Objectives

Students will be able to:  
  

*   be confident and gracious  
     
 *   have self-discipline and perseverance  
     
 *   have a deep understanding and appreciation of the Malay culture and dance through a repertoire of traditional Malay Dances- ‘Inang’, ‘Masri’, ‘Zapin’, ‘Joget’ and ‘Asli’

### Programme


Various platforms are given to students so that they are able to showcase their talents. These include performing at school and external events. From this, students will develop their self-confidence and leadership skills.
