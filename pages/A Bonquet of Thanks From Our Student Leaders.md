## &nbsp;A Bouquet of Thanks From Our Student Leaders

The school ended the student leadership training on 21 Feb 2020 with our Primary 6 student leaders writing encouragement notes for our healthcare professionals in Singapore. Through this platform, we hope to send our well wishes to the frontline staff who have worked long hours for our nation during this difficult time.&nbsp;  
  

The encouragement cards have been delivered to Singapore General Hospital, Tan Tock Seng Hospital and Khoo Teck Puat Hospital.
