**Q5. Where can i park my vehicle?**  

Due to safety considerations, please note that parking within the school grounds is not permitted unless authorised. Parking is available along the minor roads near the school (e.g.) Jalan Pacheli, Li Hwan Drive and Tai Hwan Drive. Please park discriminately and not park in front of school or residents’ gates. Do note also not to park in front of the side gate at Crichton Close as it is for emergency fire or rescue vehicle access. Please do not park within the Zebra Crossing Zone along Burghley Drive as it would impede the flow of trafﬁc especially in the morning. Parking at the Church of St Francis Xavier is strictly for parishioners attending Mass.
