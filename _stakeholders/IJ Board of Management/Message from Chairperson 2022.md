<center><b>Message from Chairperson, CHIJ Board of Management</b></center>

In the past 2 years, when the world was gripped by the pandemic, we saw God’s grace at work in the crisis as many came forward as witnesses of hope and pillars of generosity and support. As we slowly emerge from these very trying times, we give thanks to God for His mercy and love, and for giving us the strength and faith to deal with the trials that come our way. 

  

I am heartened that our schools have thus been able to resume a wide range of wholesome learning and bonding activities for students and staff. In particular, on the lovely morning of 25 May 2022, all 11 CHIJ schools in Singapore celebrated Founder’s Day together as one family, with staff and students in each school gathered to attend Mass, strengthening the spiritual bond that we share as beneficiaries of Blessed Nicolas Barré’s legacy. In the afternoon, we conducted the first ever IJ Colloquium for all teaching staff of CHIJ schools in Singapore, where teachers were energised through an online dialogue with inspiring IJ alumnae, who shared on how IJ Sisters and teachers nurtured them to grow in faith and lead with heart. On 3 June 2022, we gathered all our non-teaching staff at CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ School to share on the IJ spirit and educational philosophy, as well as show our deepest appreciation for their wholehearted contributions as our partners in IJ education. 

  

The Catholic fraternity in Singapore share the deep honour of having our Archbishop William Goh appointed to the College of Cardinals by the Holy Father, Pope Francis. William Cardinal Goh is now one of the Pope’s closest advisors and the Vatican’s highest-level administrators, assisting the Holy Father in the task of governing the Universal Church, on top of leading the archdiocese of Singapore. Representatives from all the IJ schools attended the Thanksgiving Solemn Mass and we continue to pray with joy for Cardinal Goh, as His Eminence continues to build a vibrant, evangelising and missionary church beyond Singapore. As a school community, we strive to continue to support the vision His Eminence outlined for his Cardinalate which include promoting inter-religious dialogue for human fraternity, climate action to better protect our earth, and improving the lives of others especially the poorest and the least. 

  

I am also heartened that many students, alumnae, teachers and parents from CHIJ and other Catholic schools were able to come together in September to celebrate Catholic Education Sunday (CES) at churches throughout Singapore. CES underscores the importance of the Church-Home-School partnership in nurturing youth of service and faith, where Christ is at the centre of all we do. As the family of IJ schools, we commit to live out the Gospel in every facet of the school experience and work together for the promotion of truth, justice, freedom and love.

  

 Let us continue to be guided by our IJ motto, “Simple in Virtue, Steadfast in Duty”, as we work closely to build on the foundations that our Founder Blessed Nicolas Barré, IJ Sisters and all our forebearers have forged for us. 

  

May God continue to bless CHIJ Our Lady of Good Counsel, her leaders, staff, students and parents, as always.

  

  

Yours in Christ

  

  

Ms Vivienne Lim
