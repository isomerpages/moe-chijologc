## IJ Voices
<br>
<img style="width: 50%;" src="/images/IJ%20Voices.png" align = "center" />

To celebrate the 4th centenary of the birth of Blessed Nicolas Barré, founder of the IJ schools, a book titled, ‘Touched by his call: IJ Voices’, was published. It captures 400 voices sharing how the spirit lives on in all who have encountered the IJ Family through the call of Blessed Nicolas Barré. 

  

It is hoped that all who read the contributions within will draw inspiration from the varied responses to a shared call to action. 

  

A link for the soft copy is provided in the following [microsite](https://sites.google.com/moe.edu.sg/ij-voices/home) for your perusal.

  

Additionally, you may listen to the recording of two songs penned by teachers in CHIJ OLGC at the microsite. 

  

God Bless.
