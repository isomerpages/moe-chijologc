## Chinese Language 

The Chinese Language Department aims to develop our students to be conversant in Mandarin and to inculcate an appreciation for the Chinese culture through various programmes and activities. In alignment with our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) for Drama and Literary Arts (D’LitE), all Primary 1 to Primary 5 students attend different musical and drama productions yearly. Our Primary 1 and Primary 2 students attend an 8 to 10 hours speech and drama programme in the year too. At the end of the programme, the students will put up a performance to showcase what they have learnt and parents are invited for the event.<br>

To enhance the various language skills, cultivate an appreciation for the Chinese Culture and further materialise the vision of our school and department, the Chinese Language department has arranged for the following activities and programmes to extend our students’ learning:

•	Chinese New Year Celebrations<br>
•	Mother Tongue Fortnight<br>
•	Speech and Drama Programme<br>
•	Language and Cultural Camp<br>
