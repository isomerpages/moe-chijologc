## Choir

#### Objectives

OLGC Choir CCA aims to enhance the overall arts education programme which provides opportunities for all students to be involved in the mastery of singing techniques. As such, students are given the opportunity to gain diverse skill sets, ranging from basic singing techniques to performance etiquette. They will also learn school values, teamwork and discipline as they develop into confident and accomplished stage performers when participating in various internal and external performances.  

#### Programme


During CCA practice sessions, students are taught warming up techniques that enhance voice projection, breath control, articulation of lyrics in various languages and performance etiquette. They acquire sight reading skills thus gaining confidence in score literacy. With exposure to different music genres and performances, they develop an appreciation of the arts.&nbsp;

#### Training Structure

*   Warming up  
    
*   Application of singing techniques to new music scores  
    
*   Feedback/Review  
    

#### Partnership


The choir partners parents, choir groups from other schools and the community. Parent volunteers actively help out during various performances and are very supportive in ensuring the girls’ commitment to the CCA. The choir also has choral exchanges with choir groups from other schools to build confidence and learn best practices. The community has invited the choir to perform and thus has provided various opportunities to showcase talents.
