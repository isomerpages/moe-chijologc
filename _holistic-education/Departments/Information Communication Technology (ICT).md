### Baseline ICT Standards (New Media Literacies)

In OLGC, students undergo an ICT training programme to equip them with the skills and competencies to leverage on the affordances of using technology for learning.

Students will be able to utilise appropriate digital tools and applications to organise own learning, create reports or presentations to document own learning and utilise appropriate digital tools and applications to work with others and share information.

### National Digital Explorer Programme for Primary 4 students

All Primary 4 students participate in the National Digital Explorer Programme, an e-learning module designed by ICDL Asia, the world’s leading computer skills certification.  

The programme is designed to
* develop digitally fluent students equipped with the mastery of practical digital skills for the future digital workplace and
* encourage students to be self-directed learners who take ownership of their learning.

Students enroll in an e-learning module covering skills in office productivity applications such as word processing (Microsoft Word), spreadsheets (Microsoft Excel) and presentation (Microsoft PowerPoint). This e-learning module complements and reinforces the digital skills acquired in the school’s ICT Training programme.

**Guiding Principles for Cyber Wellness:**  

*   Respect for Self and Others

Students need to:&nbsp;  

*   uphold their own dignity when online (e.g. share appropriate content and participate in only legal online activities)&nbsp;
*   respect other people online (e.g. put themselves in others’ shoes, accept diverse views and opinions, give credit when using other people’s work and seek permission where necessary, avoid sharing hurtful materials)  
    

*   Safe and Responsible Use&nbsp;

Students need to:

*   have an understanding of the risks of harmful and illegal online behaviour, and take steps to protect themselves (e.g. keep their personal information private, verify the reliability of information using various sources, take steps to avoid dangers they may encounter online)
*   &nbsp;make wise and healthy choices (e.g. maintain a healthy balance of their online and offline activities)

*   Positive Peer Influence

Students need to:  

*   be a positive role model online (e.g. share healthy and positive content, harness the affordances of technology to do good for society)  
    
*   advocate positive online behaviour (e.g. stand up for their peers online, report cases of cyber bullying to a trusted adult/authority, post encouraging remarks on social media)
