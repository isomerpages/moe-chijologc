## Counselling Services

The counselling service is available to all pupils of OLGC.  Ms Michelle Ho, the full-time school counsellor, see students who need help with learning how to cope with their emotions, problems or offer a listening ear.  The counsellor also work closely with teachers and other school personnel to help students develop social-emotional skills in areas such as building self-esteem, resolving peer conflicts, managing anger and stress and coping with grief.

Counselling is usually done during school hours from 7.30 am to 4.30 pm.  Students can also choose to make an appointment with the school counsellor.  Alternatively, school personnel or parents may refer a child for counselling.  Parents who wish to make a referral may contact their daughter’s Form Teacher/Co-Form Teacher or call the Counselling Room at 62886930.
