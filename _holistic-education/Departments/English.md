#### Our Philosophy: Nurturing Future-Ready Communicators

At the heart of our English curriculum is the commitment to developing our students who are not only literate across the literacy skills of reading, writing, speaking and listening, but also students who are articulate, empathetic, and critically aware of the world around them. Our approach integrates the national STELLAR 2.0 framework with school-specific innovations to create a dynamic learning environment.

#### The Four Pillars of Our Approach

1. **Engaging Pedagogy:**

With the pedagogical emphasis on Multiliteracies, Metacognition, and Inquiry through Dialogue in the EL classroom, our teachers enact STELLAR 2.0 to make literacy development an exciting journey–where learning is contextualised, learner-centred and one in which receptive and productive literacy skills are scaffolded, process-oriented and spiral in progression.

2. **Fostering Future-Ready Confident Communicators:**

From public speaking to media literacy to critical investigation of current affairs, we equip our students with skills to navigate a complex, digital, and globalised world.

3.**Differentiated Learning, Inclusivity and Support:**

Through Supplementary, Remedial and Learning Clinics, we ensure every child—regardless of their starting point—finds success. This structured scaffold allows our students to receive the support needed to strengthen their literacy skills.
