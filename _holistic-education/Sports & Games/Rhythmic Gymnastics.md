## RHYTHMIC GYMNASTICS

Rhythmic Gymnastics develops the students’ flexibility, rhythmic sense, physical fitness, and posture and dance movement. It combines elements of dance, ballet and gymnastics with the manipulation of different apparatus. At OLGC, students learn to perform gracefully using the ball, hoop, rope and clubs.

### Programme

Training is held at the Indoor Sports Hall every Monday and Wednesday from 2:00 to 5:00 p.m. During training, competitions and performances, students forge strong camaraderie among one another, resilience and leadership qualities.
