## Physical Education

The physical education programme aims to build a strong foundation for the development of broad-based physical competencies and opportunities for recreational participation. Building upon the physical education programme, the sports Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) programme provides opportunities for specialisation in a sport, and together, they contribute to holistic education and the development of 21st Century Competencies to better prepare our students to thrive in a fast-changing and highly-connected world.
